accounts = [
	total,

]

inputed accounts:
	IRA,
	savings,
		rent,
		services

IRA and savings are created and maybe their parent account is set here. Then a percent?
But then you can't handle the input type that would have different percentages?


total contains all other accounts and is default

IRA is a single account that doesn't contain other accounts

savings is a sum value of rent and services

paymentTypes = [
	default = payment([["IRA", 50], ["savings", 50]])
	notDefault = payment([["IRA", 25], ["savings", 75]])
]

savings.setSplit([["rent", 50], ["services", 50]])

each account stores a value,
total is the default account and stores the sum of all combined accounts
